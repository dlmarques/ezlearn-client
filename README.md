## Reflection

   This is a side project where I can evolve my skills and work with the latest and best technologies. This project allowed me to work and evolve my backend skills, build my own APIs, and increase my frontend skills too! I have experience with thinking and creating all the project and gave me much knowledge.


   At the end, the technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router 4.0, Redux, and a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX, and CSS. I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes. In the next iteration I plan on handrolling a `webpack.config.js` file to more fully understand the build process.
